- Simplify interface of `time::Waveform` by storing and updating number of past time windows (and therefore valid samples) inside waveform. A newly created waveform only has a single valid sample, which is initialized as zero. `Waveform::store()` is used to write new data to the waveform. Calling `Waveform::moveToNextWindow()` will increase the counter for valid samples and archive old samples `_timeWindows`.
